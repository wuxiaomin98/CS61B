Today's reading:  Sierra & Bates, Chapter 8.

ABSTRACT CLASSES
================
An abstract class is a class whose sole purpose is to be extended.

public abstract class List {
  protected int size;

  public int length() {
    return size;
  }

  public abstract void insertFront(Object item);
}

Abstract classes don't allow you to create objects directly.  You can declare a
variable of type List, but you can't create a List object.

  List myList;                 // Right on.
  myList = new List();         // COMPILE-TIME ERROR.

However, abstract classes can be extended in the same way as ordinary classes,
and the subclasses are usually not abstract.  (They can be, but usually they're
normal subclasses with complete implementations.)

The abstract List class above includes an abstract method, insertFront.  An
abstract method lacks an implementation.  One purpose of an abstract method is
to guarantee that every non-abstract subclass will implement the method.
Specifically, every non-abstract subclass of List must have an implementation
for the insertFront method.

  public class SList extends List {
    // inherits the "size" field.
    protected SListNode head;

    // inherits the "length" method.

    public void insertFront(Object item) {
      head = new SListNode(item, head);
      size++;
    }  
  }

If you leave out the implementation of insertFront in SList, the Java compiler
will complain that you must provide one.  A non-abstract class may never
contain an abstract method, nor inherit one without providing an
implementation.

Because SList is not abstract, we can create SList objects; and because SLists
are Lists, we can assign an SList to a List variable.

  List myList = new SList();   // Right on.
  myList.insertFront(obj);     // Right on.

What are abstract classes good for?  It's all about the interface.

             ----------------------------------------------------
             |  An abstract class lets you define an interface  |
             |    - for multiple classes to share,              |
             |    - without defining any of them yet.           |
             ----------------------------------------------------

Let's consider the List class.  Although the List class is abstract, it is an
ADT--even without any implementation!-- because it has an interface with public
method prototypes and well-defined behaviors.  We can implement an
algorithm--for example, a list sorter--based on the List interface, without
ever knowing how the lists will be implemented.  One list sorter can sort every
kind of List.

  public void listSort(List l) { ... }

In another part of the universe, your project partners can build lots of
subclasses of List:  SList, DList, TailList, and so on.  They can also build
special-case List subclasses: for example, a TimedList that records the amount
of time spent doing List operations, and a TransactionList that logs all
changes made to the list on a disk so that all information can be recovered if
a power outage occurs.  A library catalogue application that uses DLists can
send them to your listSort algorithm to be sorted.  An airline flight database
that uses TransactionLists can send them to you for sorting, too, and you don't
have to change a line of sorting code.  You may have written your list sorter
years before TransactionLists were ever thought of.

    -----------------   The list sorter is built on the foundation of a list  
    |  Application  |   ADT, and the application is built on the foundation of
    -----------------   the list sorter.  However, it's the application, and  
            |           not the list sorter, that gets to choose what kind of 
            | calls     list is actually used, and thereby obtains special    
            v           features like transaction logging.  This is a big     
    -----------------   advantage of object-oriented languages like Java.     
    |  List Sorter  |
    -----------------
            |
            | calls
            v
    -----------------
    |   List ADT    |

JAVA INTERFACES
===============
Java has an "interface" keyword which refers to something quite different than
the interfaces I defined in Lecture 8, even though the two interfaces are
related.  Henceforth, when I say "interfaces" I mean public fields, public
method prototypes, and the behaviors of public methods.  When I say "Java
interfaces" I mean Java's "interface" keyword.

A Java interface is just like an abstract class, except for two differences.
(1)  In Java, a class can inherit from only one class, even if the superclass
     is an abstract class.  However, a class can "implement" (inherit from) as
     many Java interfaces as you like.
(2)  A Java interface cannot implement any methods, nor can it include any
     fields except "final static" constants.  It only contains method
     prototypes and constants.

  public interface Nukeable {               // In Nukeable.java
    public void nuke();
  }

  public interface Comparable {             // In java.lang
    public int compareTo(Object o);
  }

  public class SList extends List implements Nukeable, Comparable {
    [Previous stuff here.]

    public void nuke() {
      head = null;
      size = 0;
    }

    public int compareTo(Object o) {
      [Returns a number < 0 if this < o,
                          0 if this.equals(o), 
                        > 0 if this > o.]
    }
  }

Observe that the method prototypes in a Java interface may be declared without
the "abstract" keyword, because it would be redundant; a Java interface cannot
contain a method implementation.

The distinction between abstract classes and Java interfaces exists because of
technical reasons that you might begin to understand if you take CS 164
(Compilers).  Some languages, like C++, allow "multiple inheritance," so that a
subclass can inherit from several superclasses.  Java does not allow multiple
inheritance in its full generality, but it offers a sort of crippled form of
multiple inheritance:  a class can "implement" multiple Java interfaces.

Why does Java have this limitation?  Multiple inheritance introduces a lot of
problems in both the definition of a language and the efficient implementation
of a language.  For example, what should we do if a class inherits from two
different superclasses two different methods or fields with the same name?
Multiple inheritance is responsible for some of the scariest tricks and traps
of the C++ language, subtleties that cause much wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Java interfaces don't have these problems.

Because an SList is a Nukeable and a Comparable, we can assign it to variables
of these types.

  Nukeable n = new SList();
  Comparable c = (Comparable) n;

The cast is required because not every Nukeable is a Comparable.

"Comparable" is a standard interface in the Java library.  By having a class
implement Comparable, you immediately gain access to Java's sorting library.
For instance, the Arrays class in java.util includes a method that sorts arrays
of Comparable objects.

  public static void sort(Object[] a)       // In java.util

The parameter's type is Object[], but a run-time error will occur if any item
stored in a is not a Comparable.

Interfaces can be extended with subinterfaces.  A subinterface can have
multiple superinterfaces, so we can group several interfaces into one.

  public interface NukeAndCompare extends Nukeable, Comparable { }

We could also add more method prototypes and constants, but in this example
I don't.
